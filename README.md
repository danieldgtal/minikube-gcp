# Minikube on GCP Exploration

This project documents my hands-on exploration of Kubernetes using Minikube on a GCP Compute Engine VM.
The goal is to refresh and deepen my Kubernetes knowledge in preparation for the KCNA, GCP and AWS Solutions Architect exams, while building daily GitHub commit habits.

---

## 🚀 What I'll Explore

✅ Set up Minikube on GCP VM (Ubuntu/Debian)  
✅ Install kubectl and verify cluster connectivity  
✅ Deploy sample workloads (nginx, busybox, etc.)  
✅ Play with Kubernetes objects:
- Pods
- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps & Secrets
- Volumes & PersistentVolumeClaims

✅ Work with Helm (optional bonus)  
✅ Enable Minikube addons (dashboard, ingress, metrics-server)  
✅ Scale deployments  
✅ Perform rolling updates and rollbacks  
✅ Practice port-forwarding, logs, and exec  
✅ Test node failure by stopping the Minikube node  
✅ Tear down cleanly
